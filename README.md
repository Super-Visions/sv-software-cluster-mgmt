Software Cluster Management
===========================

This iTop module adds the ability to manage software clusters.

## Features

Create a cluster of DB servers and assign DB schemas to it, instead of on each server separately.

## Limitations

This module removes the obsolescence condition for DatabaseSchema, meaning that objects of this type will never be considered as obsolete.
Use version 1.2.1 if you want to use this module with iTop 2.3.
